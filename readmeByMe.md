# Hi,

First of all I have to say that I did not understand the task at the very first time and I put a lot work into this project.
Because we have all the knowledge to finish this project on a proper way then I did so.
When I have checked the solution's videos I thought Cameron did not want to show us how to solve the problems.
But later I realized I should have append all information to the page line by line.
Of course I have choosed the hard way :).

I have to add few thoughts to my project as I used at some point a solution what is not mine.
I have had a One on One appointment with Karol who helped me to solve this problem.
Here it is:

```javascript
function changeBy(val) {
			privateCounter += val;
		}
		return {
			increment: function () {
				changeBy(1);
			},
			decrement: function () {
				changeBy(-1);
			},
			value: function () {
				return privateCounter;
			}
		}
```
   
You can find this code at the MDN website.
You will see why I needed this solution.

Here is the link to the thread what I used to make my questions.
[Forum](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/biography-quiz-two-placeholder-in-one-line/248996).
I provide you with this link because I want you to know that all work is mine. Of course Karol helped me lot but did not provide me with solution.

I have checked all my code but there may be errors in it.

The style is not great. I am not good at the designing.
Because my code is very complex (at least for me) I tried to use some Bootstrap feature but it just did not work.
Hope later I will be better.

Thank you for checking my code.
I really enjoyed to make this through although I had moments to throw my PC out of the window.
But it really helped me to understand this part of the course.
